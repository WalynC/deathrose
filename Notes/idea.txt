phase 1: daylight
 - plant has limited energy
 - spread roots using energy
 - robots will attempt to harm the roots if they get too close
 - collect extra energy from water and sun crystals and all that good stuff

phase 2: nightlight
 - plant uproots
 - start tearing apart the robots
 - spend energy on ways to do more damage
 - clear the way to get to more water and sun
 - get back to the roots before the sun comes and you die


todo:
 - root base
 - extend roots out from base where the player clicks
 - limited money
 - navigate the root network by clicking along the roots
 - set waypoints by ctrl+#
 - move camera to waypoints with #
 - sun: generate energy at start of daylight phase, never run out
 - water: soak up water to grow, runs out
